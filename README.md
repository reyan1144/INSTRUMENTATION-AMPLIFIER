# INSTRUMENTATION-AMPLIFIER  
# INTRODUCTION  
An instrumentation amplifier is a specialized differential amplifier designed for precise signal amplification in noisy environments. It features high input impedance, excellent common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), and adjustable gain, making it ideal for sensor signal conditioning. Unlike standard op-amps, it minimizes noise and interference, ensuring accurate measurements in applications like medical devices and industrial sensors. Typically built with three op-amps and a gain-setting resistor, it provides stable performance even in challenging conditions. Its versatility and precision make it a critical component in data acquisition and control systems.
